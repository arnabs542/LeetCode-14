从 `root` 到某个 `leaf` 的路径和等于某个给定的值。

## Method 1. Recursion
> One is going through the tree by considering at each step the node itself and its children.
> If node is *not* a leaf, one calls recursively `hasPathSum` method for its children with a sum decreased by the current node.
> If the current node is a leaf, one checks if the current sum is zero, i.e. the initial sum was discovered.
>
> Target sum 减去当前 `node.val`，然后判断当前 node 是不是 leaf node，并且减过的 sum 是否为 0；
> 如果是，则说明找到了；
> 如果不是，则继续根据 `node.left` and `node.right` 继续判断。
```java 
class Solution {
    public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        if(root == null) {
            return false;
        }
        
        sum -= root.val;
        if((root.left == null) && (root.right == null)) {
            return sum == 0;
        }
        
        return hasPathSum(root.left, sum) || hasPathSum(root.right, sum);
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis
    Time complexity : we visit each node exactly once, thus the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes.
    Space complexity : in the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only one child node, the recursion call would occur N times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be O(N). But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be log⁡(N). Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log⁡(N)). 
  
  
## Method 2. Iterations
> The idea is to visit each node with the DFS strategy, while updating the remaining sum to cumulate at each visit.

```java 
class Solution {
    public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        if(root == null) {
            return false;
        }
        
        LinkedList<TreeNode> nodeStack = new LinkedList<>();
        LinkedList<Integer> sumStack = new LinkedList<>();
        nodeStack.add(root);
        sumStack.add(sum - root.val);
        
        TreeNode node;
        int curr;
        while(!nodeStack.isEmpty()) {
            node = nodeStack.pollLast();
            curr = sumStack.pollLast();
            
            if(node.left == null && node.right == null && curr == 0) {
                return true;
            }
            
            if(node.left != null) {
                nodeStack.push(node.left);
                sumStack.push(curr - node.left.val);
            }
            if(node.right != null) {
                nodeStack.push(node.right);
                sumStack.push(curr - node.right.val);
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```  
Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity : the same as the recursion approach O(N).
    Space complexity : O(N) since in the worst case, when the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only one child node, we would keep all NNN nodes in the stack. But in the best case (the tree is balanced), the height of the tree would be log⁡(N). Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log⁡(N)).
