* Hints:
    * Use prefix sums to calculate the subarray sums.
    * Suppose you know the remainder for the sum of the entire array. How does removing a subarray affect the remainder.
    What remainder does the subarray need to have in order to make the rest of the array sum up to be divisible by k?
    * Use a map to keep track of the right most index for every prefix `sum % p`.
       
    
## Method 1. Prefix Sum with HashMap to record the last index
Key Points:
1. Calculate the `rem = sum(nums) % p`, which means we need to remove a subarray which has `sum % p == rem` to make the 
rest sum divisible by `p`.
2. It also requires that the removed subarray should be the shortest subarray.
3. Then the questions become: Find the shortest array with `sum % p == rem`.
4. Since we need the shortest length, `last[remainder] = idx` records the last `index` that `(A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[i]) % p == remainder`.
Everytime, we find a possible sum, we need get the right-most index to make sure that the subarray removed is the shortest. 
5. If there is no element what we want, then `i - (-N) > N`. Since we cannot remove the whole array, therefore, `return res` when `res < N`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSubarray(int[] nums, int p) {
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int N = nums.length;
        int rem = 0;
        for(int num: nums) {
            rem = (rem + num) % p;
        }
        Map<Integer, Integer> last = new HashMap<>();
        last.put(0, -1);
        int curr = 0;
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
            curr = (curr + nums[i]) % p;
            last.put(curr, i);
            int want = (curr - rem + p) % p;
            res = Math.min(res, i - last.getOrDefault(want, -N));
        }
        return (res < N) ? res : -1;
    }
}
```
