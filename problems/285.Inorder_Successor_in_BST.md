## Method 1. My Solution, Iteration
```java 
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        if(root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<TreeNode>();
        TreeNode curr = root;
        while(!stack.isEmpty() || curr!=null) {
            while(curr != null) {
                stack.push(curr);
                curr = curr.left;
            }
            curr = stack.pop();
            if(curr.val > p.val) {
                return curr;
            }
            curr = curr.right;
        }
        return null;
    }
}

Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity : O(Hp) in the best case, when node p has a right child. Here Hp is a height of node p. O(H) in the worst case of no right child. Here H is a tree height.
    Space complexity : O(1) in the best case, when node p has a right child. Otherwise, up to O(H) to keep the stack.


## Method 2. [Ref](https://leetcode.com/problems/inorder-successor-in-bst/solution/391688)
Here is a much simpler solution to the problem. The idea is pretty straight forward.
We start from the root, utilizing the property of BST:

    If current node's value is less than or equal to p's value, we know our answer must be in the right subtree.
    If current node's value is greater than p's value, current node is a candidate. Go to its left subtree to see if we can find a smaller one.
    If we reach null, our search is over, just return the candidate.


```java 
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        TreeNode res = null;
        TreeNode curr = root;
        
        while(curr != null) {
            if(curr.val > p.val) {
                res = curr;
                curr = curr.left;
            } else {    // cur.val <= p.val, we need find larger node in the right subtree
                curr = curr.right;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
