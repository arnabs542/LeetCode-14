    * Use a binary search. We'll binary search monotone function "possible(D) = can we use K or less gas stations to ensure
    each adjacent distance between stations is at most D?"
    
    
## Method 1. Binary Search
[[C++/Java/Python] Binary Search ](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-max-distance-to-gas-station/discuss/113633/Easy-and-Concise-Solution-using-Binary-Search-C++JavaPython)

* Explanation of solution:
Now we are using binary search to find the smallest possible value of D.
I initilze left = 0 and right = the distance between the first and the last station
count is the number of gas station we need to make it possible.
if count > K, it means mid is too small to realize using only K more stations.
if count <= K, it means mid is possible and we can continue to find a bigger one.
When left + 1e-6 >= right, it means the answer within 10^-6 of the true value and it will be accepted.

```java 
class Solution {
    public double minmaxGasDist(int[] stations, int K) {
        int count;
        int N = stations.length;
        double left = 0;
        double right = stations[N-1] - stations[0];
        double mid = 0;
        while(left + 1e-6 < right) {
            mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            count = 0;
            for(int i=0; i<N-1; i++) {
                count += Math.ceil((stations[i+1] - stations[i]) / mid) - 1;
            }
            if(count > K) {
                left = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return right;
    }
}
```
