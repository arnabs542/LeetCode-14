> A **critical connection** is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.      
> 也就是删除这条 edge，会导致一个 graph 分成两个 components。
## Method 1.

```java 
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> criticalConnections(int n, List<List<Integer>> connections) {
        int[] ids = new int[n];
        int[] lows = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(ids, -1);   // -1 means this node isn't visited
        
        // Initialize the graph, array of ArrayList
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        }
        for(List<Integer> conn: connections) {
            int a = conn.get(0);
            int b = conn.get(1);
            graph[a].add(b);
            graph[b].add(a);
        }
        
        // DFS
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>();
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if(ids[i] == -1) {
                dfs(graph, ids, lows, i, -1, res);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    private int id = 0;
    private void dfs(List<Integer>[] graph, int[] ids, int[] lows, int curr, int par, List<List<Integer>> res) {
        ids[curr] = id;
        lows[curr] = id++;
        for(int nei: graph[curr]) {
            if(nei == par) {        // avoid dead-loop
                continue;
            }
            if(ids[nei] == -1) {
                dfs(graph, ids, lows, nei, curr, res);
                lows[curr] = Math.min(lows[curr], lows[nei]);
                if(ids[curr] < lows[nei]) {
                    res.add(Arrays.asList(curr, nei));
                }
            } else {
                lows[curr] = Math.min(lows[curr], lows[nei]);
            }
        }
    }
}

## Method 2. [DFS, O(|E|) solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/discuss/382638/DFS-detailed-explanation-O(orEor)-solution)
> A theorem on a connected graph:
> * **An edge is a critical connection, if and only if it is not in a cycle.**
> * If we know how to find cycles, and discard all edges in the cycles, then the remaining connections are a complete collections of critical connections.

> How to find edges in cycles, and remove them?
> * Use DFS algorithm to find cycles and decide whether or not an edge in a cycle.
> * Define **rank** of a node: The depth of a node during a DFS. The starting node has a *rank=0*.

> How can **rank** help us with removing cycles?
> * Image you have a path of length `k` during a DFS. The nodes on the path has increasing ranks from `0` to `k` and incrementing by `1`. Surprisingly, your next visit finds a node that has a rank of `p` where `0 <= p < k`.[也就是visited 的下一个 node `p` 是已经访问过的 node]
> ==> That means we found a node that is on the current search path. ==> Congratulations, we fond a cycle.

> But only the current level of search knows it finds a cycle. How does the upper level of search knows?
> * Use the return value of DFS: `dfs` function returns the minimum rank it finds.
> * During a step of search from node `u` to its neighbors `v`, if `dfs(v)` returns something smaller than or equal to rank(u), then `u` knows its neighbor `v` helped it to find a cycle back to `u` or `u`'s ancestor.
> So `u` knows it should discard the edge `(u,v)` which is in a cycle.

> After doing dfs on all nodes, all edges in cycles are discarded. So the remaining edges are critical connections.

    public List<List<Integer>> criticalConnections(int n, List<List<Integer>> connections) {
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];

        }
        rank[node] = depth;
        int minDepthFound = depth; // can be Integer.MAX_VALUE also.
        for(Integer neighbor: graph[node]){
            if (rank[neighbor] == depth-1){ // ignore parent
                continue;
            }
            int minDepth = dfs(graph, neighbor, depth+1, rank, connectionsSet);
            minDepthFound = Math.min(minDepthFound, minDepth);
            if (minDepth <= depth){
                // to avoid the sorting just try to remove both combinations. of (x,y) and (y,x)
                connectionsSet.remove(Arrays.asList(node, neighbor)); 
                connectionsSet.remove(Arrays.asList(neighbor, node)); 
            }
