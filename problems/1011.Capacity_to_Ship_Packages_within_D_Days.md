[1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)

* Amazon, Google
* Array, Binary Search
* Hints:
    * Binary search on the answer. We need a function possible (capacity) which returns true if and only if we can do the task in D days.
 

## Method 1. Binary Search
Given the number of bags,
return the minimum capacity of each bag,
so that we can put items one by one into all bags.

We binary search the final result.
* The `left` bound is `max(A)`,
* The `right` bound is `sum(A)`.

```java 
class Solution {
    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int D) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        for(int w: weights) {
            left = Math.max(left, w);
            right += w;
        }
        
        while(left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int cnt = 1;
            int sum = 0;
            for(int w: weights) {
                if(sum + w > mid) {
                    cnt += 1;
                    sum = 0;
                }
                sum += w;
            }
            if(cnt > D) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left;    // Find the left boundary
    }
}
```
