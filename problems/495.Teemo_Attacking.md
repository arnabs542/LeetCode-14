## Method 1. My Solution, 1ms, 100.00%
Key Points:
1. Since the attacking time series is in ascending order, we can consider each attack individually.
2. If the current attacking has non-overlapping with the previous attacking (including duration), then we can direction add duration time for previous attack.
3. If the current attacking has overlapping with the previous attacking (including duration), we need to merge some attack together.
4. The special case is the last one: Do the last attacking have overlapping with the previous one or not?
    * If yes, we do not need to add duration for the last attacking;
    * If no, we need to add duration for the last attacking.
    
```java
class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
        if(timeSeries == null || timeSeries.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int res = 0;
        boolean covered = false;
        for(int i=1; i<timeSeries.length; i++) {
            if(timeSeries[i-1] + duration < timeSeries[i]) {
                res += duration;
            } else {    // i.s. timeSeries[i-1] + duration >= timeSeries[i]
                int anchor = i - 1;
                while(i < timeSeries.length && timeSeries[i-1] + duration >= timeSeries[i]) {
                    i++;
                }   // after this while-loop, timeSeries[i-1] + duration < timeSeries[i]
                res += (timeSeries[i-1] - timeSeries[anchor]) + duration;
                covered = (i == timeSeries.length);
            }
        }
        return res + (covered ? 0 : duration);
    }
}
```
Complexity:
1. Time: O(N)
2. Space: O(1)


## Method 2. [One Pass](https://leetcode.com/problems/teemo-attacking/solution/)
```java
class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
        if(timeSeries == null || timeSeries.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<timeSeries.length-1; i++) {
            res += Math.min(timeSeries[i+1] - timeSeries[i], duration);
        }
        return res + duration;
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis
1. Time complexity : O(N), where N is the length of the input list, since we iterate the entire list.
2. Space complexity : O(1), it's a constant space solution.
