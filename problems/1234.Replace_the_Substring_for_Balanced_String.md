[1234. Replace the Substring for Balanced String](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-the-substring-for-balanced-string/)

* Accolite
* Two Pointers, String
* Hints:
    * Use 2-pointers algorithm to make sure all amount of characters outside the 2 points are smaller or equal to `n/4` [保证在 two pointers 之外的, the amount of characters are smaller or equal to N/4]
    * That means you need to count the amount of each letter and make sure the amount is enough.
    
    
## Method 1. [[Java/C++/Python] Sliding Window](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-the-substring-for-balanced-string/discuss/408978/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Sliding-Window)
This time we don't care the count of elements inside the window, we want to know the count outside the window.

Key Points:
1. We can make the whole string balanced, as long as `max(count[Q], count[W], count[E], count[R]) <= N / 4`;
2. The substring before index `i`, i.e. `str[0, i-1]`, is valid. 
3. The sliding window here is `[i, j]`, represent the range of characters we may need to replace.
4. After `count[s.charAt(j)]--`, the rest `count` represents the amount of different characters outside the range `[i, j]`, i.e. `[0, i)` + `(j, N-1]`;
5. `while(i < N && count['Q'] <= k && count['W'] <= k && count['E'] <= k && count['R'] <= k)`, means that when number of each character outside of `[i, j]` are valid, then we can try to shrink the window.
```java
class Solution {
    public int balancedString(String s) {
        int[] count = new int[128];
        int N = s.length();
        int res = N;
        int i = 0;
        int k = N / 4;
        // Count the freq of each character
        for(int j=0; j<N; j++) {
            count[s.charAt(j)]++;
        }
        
        for(int j=0; j<N; j++) {
            count[s.charAt(j)]--;
            while(i < N && count['Q'] <= k && count['W'] <= k && count['E'] <= k && count['R'] <= k) {
                res = Math.min(res, j - i + 1);     // [i, ..., j] 
                ++count[s.charAt(i++)];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
Complexity:
1. Time O(N), one pass for counting, one pass for sliding window
2. Space O(1)


## Method 2.[[JAVA] Sliding Window Solution with Explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-the-substring-for-balanced-string/discuss/409017/JAVA-Sliding-Window-Solution-with-Explanation)
Essentially, we reduced the problem to find a minimum substring containing a certain number of each character.
```java
class Solution {
	// Checks that freq[char] <= 0 meaning we have an elligible substring
    private boolean fulfilled(int[] freq) {
        boolean fulfilled = true;
        for(int f: freq) {
            if(f > 0) fulfilled = false;
        }
        return fulfilled;
    }
    
	 // Q 0 W 1 E 2 R 3
    private int charToIdx(char c) {
        switch(c) {
            case 'Q': return 0;
            case 'W': return 1;
            case 'E': return 2;
        }
        return 3;
    }
    
    public int balancedString(String s) {
        // 1) Find freq of each first
        int N = s.length();
        int required = N/4;
       
        int[] freq = new int[4];
        for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            ++freq[charToIdx(c)];
        }
        
        // 2) Determine the ones we need to change
        boolean equal = true;
        for(int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            if(freq[i] != required) equal = false;
            freq[i] = Math.max(0, freq[i] - required);
        }
        
        if(equal) return 0; // Early return if all are equal
        
        // 3) Use sliding window and try to track what more is needed to find smallest window
        int start = 0;
        int minLen = N; // Maximum will only ever be N
        
        for(int end = 0; end < N; ++end) {
            char c = s.charAt(end);
            --freq[charToIdx(c)];
            
            while(fulfilled(freq)) {
                minLen = Math.min(end - start + 1, minLen);

                char st = s.charAt(start);
                ++freq[charToIdx(st)];
                ++start;
            }
        }
        
        return minLen;
    }
}
```
