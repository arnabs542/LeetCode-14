[1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule/)

* Amazon, SAP, Swiggy
* Dynamic Programming
* Hints:
	* Use DP. Try to cut the array into d non-empty sub-arrays. Try all possible cuts for the array.
	* Use `dp[i][j]` where DP states are `i` the index of the last cut and `j` the number of 
	  remaining cuts. Complexity is `O(n * n * d)`.



Points:

1. You have to finish **at least** one task every day.
2. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.
3. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days.
4. Return the **minimum difficulty** of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return **-1**.



## Method 1. Top-Down DP

Key Points:

1. `dp(i, j)` points to the optimal min splitting of jobs in `jobs(j, len-1)` into i days. Thus, `dp(d,0)` is the desired answer.
2. For `dp(i+1,j)`, the job at `j` must be done on day 1 (given j >= i+1). The job at `j+1` may or may not happen on day 1.
3. To obtain `dp(i+1,j)`, we must minimize `max(difficulty of jobs j,...,k done on day 1) + dp(i,k+1)`.



Key Points:

1. `dfs(...)` help to find the minimum difficulty if start work at `i-th` job with `d` days left.
2. If `d == 1`, only one day left, we have to do all jobs, return the maximum difficulty of jobs.
3. Complexity:
   1. Time complexity: `O(nnd)`
   2. Space complexity: `O(nd)`

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDifficulty(int[] jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int N = jobDifficulty.length;
        // No enough jobs for every day
        if(N < d) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        int[][] memo = new int[N][d+1];
        for(int[] row: memo) {
            Arrays.fill(row, -1);
        }
        
        return dfs(d, 0, jobDifficulty, memo);  // d days left, and start with 0-th job
    }
    
    private int dfs(int d, int idx, int[] jobDifficulty, int[][] memo) {
        int N = jobDifficulty.length;
        if(d == 0 && idx == N) {    // No days left and all jobs are done.
            return 0;
        }
        if(d == 0 || idx == N) {    // No days left but still has jobs haven't finished yet, or has days left but no jobs
            return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        
        if(memo[idx][d] != -1) {
            return memo[idx][d];
        }
        
        int curMax = jobDifficulty[idx];
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i=idx; i < N; i++) {
            curMax = Math.max(curMax, jobDifficulty[i]);
            int temp = dfs(d-1, i+1, jobDifficulty, memo);  // Finish the rest jobs in d-1 days.
            if(temp != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                min = Math.min(min, temp + curMax);
            }
        }
        memo[idx][d] = min;
        return memo[idx][d];
    }
}
```



## Method 2. Bottom-up 2D DP

Key Points:

1. `dp[i][j]` represents schedule `jobs[0, ..., j+1]` into `i+1` days. Then `dp[D-1][N-1]` represents the final result.
2. `dp[d][j] = Math.min(dp[d][j], dp[d-1][schedule-1] + localMax);`

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDifficulty(int[] jobDifficulty, int D) {
        int N = jobDifficulty.length;
        if(N < D) { // No enough jobs for each day
            return -1;
        }
        
        int[][] dp = new int[D][N];
        dp[0][0] = jobDifficulty[0];    // dp[i][j] represents (i+1) days, (j+1) jobs, i.e. schedule (j+1) jobs in (i+1) days
        for(int j=1; j<N; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = Math.max(dp[0][j-1], jobDifficulty[j]);
        }   // dp[0][N-1] represents schedule N jobs in 1 day.
        
        for(int d=1; d<D; d++) {
            for(int j=d; j<N; j++) {    // start from j=d, i.e. left 0~(d-1) for the first d days, dp[1][1], dp[1][2],...
                int localMax = jobDifficulty[j];;
                dp[d][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for(int i=j; i>=d; i--) {
                    localMax = Math.max(localMax, jobDifficulty[i]);
                    dp[d][j] = Math.min(dp[d][j], dp[d-1][i-1]+localMax);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[D-1][N-1];
    }
}
```

Complexity:

* Time complexity `O(nnd)`

* Space complexity `O(nd)`
