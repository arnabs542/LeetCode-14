[933. Number of Recent Calls](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/)

* Yandex
* Queue


## Method 1. My Solution
```java
class RecentCounter {
    
    private Deque<Integer> queue;

    public RecentCounter() {
        queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
    }
    
    public int ping(int t) {
        queue.addLast(t);
        while(queue.peekFirst() < t - 3000) {
            queue.pollFirst();
        }
        return queue.size();
    }
    
}
```


## Method 1. Iteration over Sliding Window
> The idea is that we can use a container such as **array** or **list** to keep track of all the 
> incoming ping calls. At each occasion of `ping(t)` call, first we append the call to the 
> container, and then starting from the current call, we **iterate backwards** to count the 
> calls that fall into the range of `[t-3000, t]` (including t-3000 and t).

> One optimization that we could do is that rather than keeping all the **historical** ping 
> calls in the container, we could **remove** the outdated calls on the go, which can avoid the 
> overflow of the container and reduce the memory consumption to the least.

> Based on the above description, the **list** data structure seems to be more fit as the 
> container for our tasks, than the **array**. Because the list is more adapted for the 
> following two operations:
> * Appending: we will append each incoming call to the tail of the sliding window.
> * Popping: we need to pop out all the outdated calls from the head of the sliding window.

```java
class RecentCounter {
    
    private LinkedList<Integer> slidingWindow;

    public RecentCounter() {
        slidingWindow = new LinkedList<>();
    }
    
    public int ping(int t) {
        // Step 1. Append the current call
        slidingWindow.addLast(t);
        
        // Step 2: Invalidate the outdated pings
        while(slidingWindow.getFirst() < t - 3000) {
            slidingWindow.removeFirst();
        }
        return slidingWindow.size();
    }
}

/**
 * Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * RecentCounter obj = new RecentCounter();
 * int param_1 = obj.ping(t);
 */
```

Complexity:
* Time Complexity: O(1)
* Space Complexity: O(1)
