## Method 1. Intersection of two sets

```java 
class Solution {
    public int[] intersection(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Set<Integer> set1 = new HashSet<Integer>();
        for(int num: nums1) {
            set1.add(num);
        }
        
        Set<Integer> set2 = new HashSet<Integer>();
        for(int num: nums2) {
            set2.add(num);
        }
        
        set1.retainAll(set2);
        int[] res = new int[set1.size()];
        int i = 0;
        for(int num: set1) {
            res[i++] = num;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

> Retains only the elements in this collection that are contained in the specified collection (optional operation). 
> In other words, removes from this collection all of its elements that are not contained in the specified collection. 

Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity : `O(n+m)` in the average case and `O(n√óm)` in the worst case when load factor is high enough.
    Space complexity : `O(n+m)` in the worst case when all elements in the arrays are different.
