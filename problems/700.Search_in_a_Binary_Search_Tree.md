### Method 1. Recursion
```java 
class Solution {
    public TreeNode searchBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        if(root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if(root.val == val) {
            return root;
        } else if(root.val < val) {
            return searchBST(root.right, val);
        } else {
            return searchBST(root.left, val);
        }
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity : O(H), where H is a tree height. That results in O(log N) in the average case (i.e. a balanded BST), and O(N) in the worst case.
    Space complexity : O(H) to keep the recursion stack, i.e. O(log N) in the average case (i.e. a balanded BST), and O(N) in the worst case.


## Method 2. Iteration
> To reduce the space complexity, one could convert recursive approach into the iterative one:
```java 
class Solution {
    public TreeNode searchBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        while(root != null && root.val != val) {
            if(root.val < val) {
                root = root.right;
            } else {
                root = root.left;
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity : O(H), where H is a tree height. That results in O(log N) in the average case, and O(N) in the worst case.
    Space complexity : O(1) since it's a constant space solution.
