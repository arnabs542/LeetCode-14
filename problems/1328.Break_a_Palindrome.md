[1328. Break a Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/break-a-palindrome/)

* Roblox, JPMorgan
* String
* Hints:
    * How to detect if there is impossible to perform the replacement? Only when the length = 1.
    * Change the first non `a` to `a`.
    * What if the string has only `a`? ==> Change the last character to `b`.
    
    
Example:

    case 1: "aba"
    
    
## Method 1. [[Java/C++/Python] Easy and Concise](https://leetcode.com/problems/break-a-palindrome/discuss/489774/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Easy-and-Concise)
Check half of the string,
replace a non 'a' character to 'a'.

If only one character, return empty string.
Otherwise repalce the last character to 'b'

```java
class Solution {
    public String breakPalindrome(String palindrome) {
        char[] ss = palindrome.toCharArray();
        int n = ss.length;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            if(ss[i] != 'a') {
                ss[i] = 'a';
                return String.valueOf(ss);
            }
        } 
        ss[n-1] = 'b';  // if all 'a'
        return n < 2 ? "" : String.valueOf(ss);
    }
}
```

It only needs to track half of `S` because it's a palindrome.
If there is a character which is not `a` in S except the middle position, it will certainly be in the first half.

* If `s = "aadaa"`, no matter we change the character `d` to which character, the string is always a palindrom;
Therefore, we have to change the last character to `b`.
