## Method 1. Linear Scan with Two Pointers

题目中只要求递增的三个即可，所以考虑有两个变量记录前面两个满足递增的变量即可，如果第三个变量大于前两个，则说明存在 Increasing Triplet。
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean increasingTriplet(int[] nums) {
        // Start with two largest values, as soon as we find a number bigger than both,
        // while both have been updated, return true
        int small = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int big = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int n: nums) {
            if(n <= small) {        // update small if n is smaller than both
                small = n;
            } else if(n <= big) {   // update big only if greater than small but smaller than big
                big = n;
            } else {                // return if you find a number bigger than both
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis
1. Time complexity : `O(N)` where `N` is the size of nums. We are updating `first_num` and `second_num` as we are scanning nums.
2. Space complexity : `O(1)` since we are not consuming additional space other than variables for two numbers.
