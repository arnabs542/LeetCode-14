[1153. String Transforms Into Another String](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-transforms-into-another-string/)

* Google, Amazon
* Graph
* Hints:
    * Model the problem as a graph problem. Add an edge from one character to another if you need to convert between them.
    * What if one character needs to be converted into more than one character? There would be no solution. Thus, every node can have at most one outgoing edge.
    * How to process a linked list?
    * How to process a cycle?
    * What if there is a character with no outgoing edge? You can use it to break all cycle.
    

## Method 1. [Need One Unused Character](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-transforms-into-another-string/discuss/355382/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Need-One-Unused-Character)
To realise the transformation:

    1. transformation of link link ,like `a -> b -> c`:
        we do the transformation from end to begin, that is b->c then a->b

    2. transformation of cycle, like `a -> b -> c -> a`:
        in this case we need a tmp
        `c->tmp, b->c a->b and tmp->a`
        Same as the process of swap two variable.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canConvert(String s1, String s2) {
        if(s1.equals(s2)) {
            return true;
        }
        
        Map<Character, Character> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i=0; i<s1.length(); i++) {
            if(map.getOrDefault(s1.charAt(i), s2.charAt(i)) != s2.charAt(i)) {
                return false;
            }
            map.put(s1.charAt(i), s2.charAt(i));
        }
        return new HashSet<Character>(map.values()).size() < 26;
    }
}
```
Complexity

    Time O(N) for scanning input
    Space O(26) to record the mapping
    
running time can be improved if count available character during the scan.
