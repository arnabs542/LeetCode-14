## Key Points
1. Reverse Polish Notation is not a **reverse** form of Polish Notation. It is a bit different.
2. When the input type is an array of strings, not an array of chars, we should be comparing them with `.equals(...)`, not `==`.
3. **Some programming languages** (e.g. Python, but not C++ and Java) do not truncate towards 0 with division, so you'll need to figure out how to make them do so.
4. Did you put numbers around the correct way? e.g. the test case ["12", "7", "-"] means you should calculate `12 - 7 = 5`, and not `7 - 12 = -5`.

## Division between two integers should truncate towards zero
1. When dividing 2 positive numbers, we always truncate down to the nearest integer. For example, `9 / 5 = 1 (1.8)`
    1. The result is truncated to a **less than or equal number**, i.e. `1` is less than `1.8`;
    2. The truncation is towards zero, i.e. `1` is closer to zero than `1.8` is.
2. For negative numbers, however, it is **impossible** to satisfy both of these, so one or the other has to be picked. For example, `-9 / 5 = ? (-1.8)`
    1. If we want the truncated result to be **smaller**, we'd have to go to `-2`, as `-2 < -1`;
    2. If we want the truncated result to be **nearer to zero**, we'd have to go to `-1` as `-1` is nearer to zero than `-2` is.
   
    Some programming languages go with the first definition, and others go with the second. 

## What is Infix Notation(中缀符号)?

## What is Reverse Polish Notation?
> While there are operations remaining in the list, find the left-most operator. Apply it to the 2 numbers immediately before it,
> and replace all 3 tokens (the operator and 2 numbers) with the result.
>
> For example in the simplest case of `3 4 +` when we reach `+`, we can replace `3 4 + ` with its result `7`.

    
## Method 1. Reducing the List In-place
> A pointer is used to step through the list, and each time an operator (`+ - * /`) is found, the operator is then applied to the 2 values before it (which are always numbers, as long as the original input was valid).
> The 3 values are then replaced with the result.
> This process is replaced until the list of length 1, containing a single number that is the answer to be returned.



## Method 2. Evaluate with Stack

```java 
class Solution {
    public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
        for(String s: tokens) {
            switch(s) {
                case "+":
                    stack.push(stack.pop() + stack.pop());
                    break;
                case "-":
                    stack.push(-stack.pop() + stack.pop());
                    break;
                case "*":
                    stack.push(stack.pop() * stack.pop());
                    break;
                case "/":
                    int n2 = stack.pop();
                    int n1 = stack.pop();
                    stack.push(n1 / n2);
                    break;
                default:
                    stack.push(Integer.parseInt(s));
            }
        }
        return stack.pop();
    }
}
```


## Method 3. Evalute using stack based on array
```java 
class Solution {
    public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {
        int[] nums = new int[tokens.length / 2 + 1];
        int idx = 0;
        for(String s: tokens) {
            switch(s) {
                case "+":
                    nums[idx-2] = nums[idx-2] + nums[idx-1];
                    idx--;  // The value at position idx-1 should be replaced.
                    break;
                case "-":
                    nums[idx-2] -= nums[idx-1];
                    idx--;
                    break;
                case "*":
                    nums[idx-2] *= nums[idx-1];
                    idx--;
                    break;
                case "/":
                    nums[idx-2] /= nums[idx-1];
                    idx--;
                    break;
                default:
                    nums[idx++] = Integer.parseInt(s);
                    break;
            }
        }
        return nums[0];
    }
}
```
