## Method 1. Recursive
```java
class Solution {
    private TreeNode res;
    
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        recurseTree(root, p, q);
        return res;
    }
    
    private boolean recurseTree(TreeNode curr, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        // If reached the end of a branch, return false
        if(curr == null) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Left branch. If left recursion returns ture, set left=1 else 0
        int left = recurseTree(curr.left, p, q) ? 1 : 0;
        int right = recurseTree(curr.right, p, q) ? 1 : 0;
        
        // If the current node is one of p or q
        int mid = (curr == p || curr == q) ? 1 : 0;
        
        if(mid + left + right >= 2) {
            res = curr;
        }
        return mid + left + right > 0;  // > 0: means we find at least one node of p and q
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis
1. Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. In the worst case we might be visiting all the nodes of the binary tree.
2. Space Complexity: O(N). This is because the maximum amount of space utilized by the recursion stack would be NNN since the height of a skewed binary tree could be N.


## Method 2. Recursion
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root==null || root==p || root==q) {
            return root;
        }
        
        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        
        return (left == null) ? right : (right == null) ? left : root;
    }
}
```
