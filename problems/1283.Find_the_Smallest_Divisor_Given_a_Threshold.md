[1283. Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-smallest-divisor-given-a-threshold/)

* Salesforce, ByteDance
* Binary Search
* Hints:
    * Examine every possible number for solution. Choose the largest of them.
    * Use binary search to reduce the time complexity.
    

## Method 1. Binary Search
Consider the result:
If the `sum > threshold`, the divisor is too small;
If the `sum <= threshold`, the divisor is big enough.

Complexity:
Time: `O(N log M)`, where `M = max(nums)`;
Space: `O(1)`

```java 
class Solution {
    public int smallestDivisor(int[] nums, int threshold) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = (int)10e6;
        while(left < right) {
            int m = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int sum = 0;
            for(int num: nums) {
                sum += (num + m - 1) / m;   // Round up.
            }
            if(sum > threshold) {   // divisor is too small
                left = m + 1;
            } else {                // divisor is large enough, we can try to make it smaller
                right = m;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
}
