* Hints:
    * How many times does every stick contribute to the answer?
    * Some of the sticks will be used more than others. Which sticks should be used the most/least?
    * The stick with long lengths cost a lot so we should use these the least.
    * What if we keep merging the two shortest sticks?
    

## Method 1. PriorityQueue
Key Points:
1. Connect the smallest elements first.
```java
class Solution {
    public int connectSticks(int[] sticks) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> queue = new PriorityQueue<>();
        int res = 0;
        
        for(int stick: sticks) {
            queue.offer(stick);
        }
        
        while(queue.size() > 1) {
            int cost = queue.poll() + queue.poll();
            queue.offer(cost);
            res += cost;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
Time Complexity: O(nlogn)

or
```java
class Solution {
    public int connectSticks(int[] sticks) {
        if(sticks == null || sticks.length < 2) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> (a - b));
        for(int stick: sticks) {
            pq.offer(stick);
        }
        
        int res = 0;
        while(pq.size() > 1) {
            int tmp1 = pq.poll();
            int tmp2 = pq.poll();
            res += (tmp1 + tmp2);
            pq.offer(tmp1+tmp2);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
