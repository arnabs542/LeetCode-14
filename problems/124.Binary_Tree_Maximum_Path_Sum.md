## Method 1. Recursion
> Implement a function `max_gain(node)` which takes a node as an argument and computes a maximum contribution that this node and one/zero of its subtrees could add.        
> `max_gain(node)` 以 `node` 做为参数，返回包含该 `node` 以及该 `node` 的 0 个或 1 个子树的最大值。      
> In other words, it's a *maximum gain* one could have including the node (and maybe one of its subtree) into the path.  


```java 
class Solution {
    private int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        maxGain(root);
        return max;
    }
    
    private int maxGain(TreeNode node) {
        if(node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Max sum on the left and right sub-tree of node
        int leftGain = Math.max(0, maxGain(node.left));
        int rightGain = Math.max(0, maxGain(node.right));
        
        // The price to start a new path where 'node' is a highest node
        int priceNewPath = node.val + leftGain + rightGain; // i.e. the subtree rooted at this node
        
        // Update the max sum of it's better to start a new path
        max = Math.max(max, priceNewPath);
        
        // For recursion: return the max gain if continue the same path
        return node.val + Math.max(leftGain, rightGain);
    }
}
```

or 
```java 
class Solution {
    private int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        helper(root);
        return max;
    }
    
    private int helper(TreeNode node) {
        if(node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int l = Math.max(0, helper(node.left));
        int r = Math.max(0, helper(node.right));
        max = Math.max(max, l + node.val + r);
        return node.val + Math.max(l, r);
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity: O(N), where N is number of nodes, since we visit each node not more than 2 times.
    Space complexity: O(H), where HHH is a tree height, to keep the recursion stack. In the average case of balanced tree, the tree height H=log⁡N, in the worst case of skewed tree, H=N.
