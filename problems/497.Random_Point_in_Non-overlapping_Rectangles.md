## Method 1. Prefix Sum and Binary Search
[Ref](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-point-in-non-overlapping-rectangles/solution/)         
Is there a way to select a rectangle to sample from, such that the probabilities are proportional to the number of points contained in each rectangle?

Use binary search to find the index x where x is the lowest index such that target < p[x]. 

The only step remaining is to choose a random point in `rects[x]`. 
Generating random x_coordinate and y_coordinate within this rectangle area will suffice, but we can also reuse target by mapping it to the point
```java 
x_coordinate=x1+(targ−p[i]+w[i])%(x2−x1+1)
y_coordinate=y1+(targ−p[i]+w[i])/(x2−x1+1)
```

```java 
class Solution {

    private int[][] rects;
    private List<Integer> areas;
    private int total;
    private Random rand;
    public Solution(int[][] rects) {
        this.areas = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        this.rects = rects;
        this.rand = new Random();
        for(int[] rect: rects) {
            total += (rect[2] - rect[0] + 1) * (rect[3] - rect[1] + 1);  // the total area
            areas.add(total);
        }
    }
    
    public int[] pick() {
        int target = rand.nextInt(total);
        
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = rects.length - 1;
        while(lo != hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if(target >= areas.get(mid)) {
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                hi = mid;
            }
        }
        int[] rect = rects[lo];
        int width = rect[2] - rect[0] + 1;
        int height = rect[3] - rect[1] + 1;
        int base = areas.get(lo) - width * height;
        return new int[]{rect[0] + (target - base) % width, rect[1] + (target - base) / width};
    }
}
