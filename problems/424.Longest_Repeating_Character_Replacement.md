## Method 1. [Java 12 lines O(n) sliding window solution with explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/discuss/91271/Java-12-lines-O(n)-sliding-window-solution-with-explanation)

Key Points:
1. `j - i + 1 - maxCount` represents the number of chars that need to be replaced in the range `s[i, j]`.
2. **`maxCount` may be invalid at some points, but this doesn't matter, because it wal valid earlier in the string, and all that matters is finding the max window that occurred anywhere in the string.**
Additionally, it will expand **if and only if** enough repeating characters appear in the window. So whenever is expands, it's a valid expansion.

```java
class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int len = s.length();
        int[] count = new int[26];
        int maxCount = 0;
        int maxLength = 0;
        for(int i=0, j=0; j<len; j++) {
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, ++count[s.charAt(j) - 'A']);
            while(j - i + 1 - maxCount > k) {   // more than k elements need to change in the range [i, j]
                count[s.charAt(i) - 'A']--;
                i++;
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, j - i + 1);
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```
Complexity:
1. Time: O(N)
2. Space: O(N)

Key Points:
1. The problem says that we can make at most k changes to the string (any character can be replaced with any other character). So, let's say there were no constraints like the k. Given a string convert it to a string with all same characters with minimal changes. The answer to this is
    * `length of the entire string - number of times of the maximum occurring character in the string`
2. Given this, we can apply the at most k changes constraint and maintain a sliding window such that
    * `(length of substring - number of times of the maximum occurring character in the substring) <= k`
