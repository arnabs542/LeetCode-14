## Method 1. Loop and Flip, i.e. bitmask
Key Points:
1. Check each of the 32 bits of the number. If the bit is `1`, we increase the amount of 1-bits.
2. Check the `i-th` bit of a number using a *bit mask*.
```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        int mask = 1;
        for(int j=0; j<32; j++) {
            if((n & mask) != 0) {
                res++;
            }
            mask <<= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: The run time depends on the number of bits in `n`. Because `n` in this piece of code is a 32-bit integer, the time complexity is `O(1)`.

* Space Complexity: The space complexity is`O(1)`, since no additional space is allocated.

## Method 2. Bit Manipulation Trick

Instead of checking every bit of the number, we repeatedly flip the *least-significant* 1-bit of the number to 0, and add 1 to the result. As soon as the number becomes 0, we know that there is no any more 1-bits, and we can return the result.

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        while(n != 0) {
            n &= (n-1);
            res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: The run time depends on the number of 1-bits in `n`. In the worst case, all bits in `n` are 1-bits. In case of a 32-bit integer, the run time is O(1).

* Space Complexity: The space complexity is `O(1)`, since no additional space is allocated.
