> The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections.
> The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to child (cannot be the reverse).

## Method 1. Top Down Depth-first Search
Key Points:
1. **Binary Tree** is different with **Binary Search Tree**.
2. A top-down approach is similar to an pre-order traversal.
3. We use a variable `length` to store the current consecutive path length and pass it down the tree.
4. As we traverse, we compare the current node with its parent node to determine if it is consecutive or not.
5. 在 Top-Down method 中，用一个变量 `length` 记录从一个 `node` 到 `curr` node 的距离，比如在 `dfs(root, null, 0)` 中，其中 `0` 
代表了当前的长度，不包括当前的 `root` node。由于当前 `root` 可能为 `null`，所以当前的 `length` 最好不要包括 current `root`，所以初始化
的时候，`length = 0`。

```java
class Solution {
    private int maxLen = 0;
    public int longestConsecutive(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root, null, 0);
        return maxLen;
    }
    
    private void dfs(TreeNode curr, TreeNode parent, int length) {
        if(curr == null) {
            return;
        }
        length = (parent != null && curr.val == parent.val + 1) ? length + 1 : 1;
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, length);
        dfs(curr.left, curr, length);
        dfs(curr.right, curr, length);
    }
}
```
Complexity analysis
1. Time complexity : `O(n)`. The time complexity is the same as an in-order traversal of a binary tree with nnn nodes.
2. Space complexity : `O(n)`. The extra space comes from implicit stack space due to recursion. For a skewed binary tree, 
the recursion could go up to `n` levels deep.


## Method 2. Bottom Up Depth-first Search
* The bottom-up approach is similar to a post-order traversal. We return the consecutive path length starting at current 
node to its parent.

Key Points:
1. `public int dfs(TreeNode curr)` return the length of the longest path.
2. `int L = dfs(curr.left) + 1;` represents the length of the longest path in the left branch, i.e. curr --> curr.left,
this means the value of child should be larger than curr node itself.
3. If the curr and curr.child are not consecutive, then the length (i.e. `L` or `R`) should be reset to 1.
4. 在 Bottom-Up method 中，length 的计算是从 bottom 往上走，比如当 `curr == null` 的时候，`return 0` 是 base case，往上就有
`L = dfs(curr.left) + 1`, `R = dfs(curr.right) + 1`.

```java
class Solution {
    private int maxLen = 0;
    public int longestConsecutive(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root);
        return maxLen;
    }
    
    public int dfs(TreeNode curr) {
        if(curr == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int L = dfs(curr.left) + 1; // +1 represent the curr node.
        int R = dfs(curr.right) + 1;
        
        // If not consecutive, reset length to 1
        if(curr.left != null && curr.val + 1 != curr.left.val) {
            L = 1;
        }
        // If not consecutive, reset length to 1
        if(curr.right != null && curr.val + 1 != curr.right.val) {
            R = 1;
        }
        int len = Math.max(L, R);
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, len);
        return len;
        
    }
}
```
