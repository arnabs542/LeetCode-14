## Method 1. Union Find
Key Points:
1. The cities are labeled from `1` to `N`. Therefore, it will cause wrong result use `uf.count == 1`, 
We may try to use `uf.count == 2`, since, we can consider `0` as a single city.

```java
class Solution {
    private int[] parent;
    public int minimumCost(int N, int[][] connections) {
        parent = new int[N + 1];
        for(int i=0; i<=N; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(connections, (a, b) -> (a[2] - b[2]));
        int res = 0;
        for(int[] conn: connections) {
            if(!isConnected(conn[0], conn[1])) {
                connect(conn[0], conn[1]);
                N--;
                res += conn[2];
            }
        }
        return (N == 1) ? res : -1;
    }
    
    private boolean isConnected(int i, int j) {
        return find(i) == find(j);
    }
    
    private int find(int i) {
        if(parent[i] != i) {    // path compression
            parent[i] = find(parent[i]);
        }
        return parent[i];
    }
    
    private void connect(int i, int j) {
        int pi = find(i);
        int pj = find(j);
        parent[pi] = pj;
    }
}
```

## Some Background 
1. **Minimum Spanning Tree:** In an undirected weighted graph, there is a tree (`N` nodes, `N - 1` edges so no circle) that connects all nodes in the graph, and the sum of path weights are minimum. 在无向图中，存在一棵树，这颗树的 path sum 是最小的。
2. **Kruskal's Algorithm:** The approach to find the Minimum Spanning Tree in the Graph. We **sort** the edges by weight in non - descending order and loop sorted edges, **pick** the edge as long as there are no connectivity already set up between two nodes and **add** this edge weight to the total weight.
3. **Disjoint Set:** The data structure used to check the connectivity of graph efficiently in dynamic by union the nodes into one set, and find the number of disconnected sets.


## Reference
1. [Java Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm with Union Find](https://leetcode.com/problems/connecting-cities-with-minimum-cost/discuss/344867/Java-Kruskal's-Minimum-Spanning-Tree-Algorithm-with-Union-Find)
  
    Idea is simple:

        Sort edges to no-descresing order
        Pick the smallest edge that does not form a cycle
        Repeat until MST is formed and every node is connected.

    Implemented Union-Find with path comression to improve efficiency.
