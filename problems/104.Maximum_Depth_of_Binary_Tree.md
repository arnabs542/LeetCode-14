## Method 1. BFS (My solution), Iteration
```java 
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.offer(root);
        int depth = 0;
        
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            depth++;
            int size = queue.size();
            for(int i=0; i<size; i++) {
                TreeNode curr = queue.poll();
                if(curr.left != null) {
                    queue.offer(curr.left);
                }
                if(curr.right != null) {
                    queue.offer(curr.right);
                }
            }
        }
        return depth;
    }
}
```
Complexity analysis

    Time complexity : O(N).
    Space complexity : in the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only left child node, the recursion call would occur N times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be O(N). But in the average case (the tree is balanced), the height of the tree would be log⁡(N). Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log⁡(N)).


## Method 2. Recursion 
```java 
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int left = maxDepth(root.left);
        int right = maxDepth(root.right);
        
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```
Complexity analysis

    Time complexity : we visit each node exactly once, thus the time complexity is O(N), where NNN is the number of nodes.

    Space complexity : in the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only left child node, the recursion call would occur N times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be O(N). But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be log⁡(N). Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log⁡(N)).
