[946. Validate Stack Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/)	**Stack operation**

* Google
* Stack

## Method 1. Greedy
Key Points:
> * We have to push the items in order. [对 item 的 push 操作必须按照 item 在 `pushed` 中的顺序。]
> * If the top value is the value that we want to pop next, then we must do it now. 
> That's because any subsequent push make the top of the stack different from the value that we want to pop,
> and we will never be able to pop again. [如果`栈顶元素`就是我们要 pop 的元素，则需要 `pop` immediately，否在将没有机会 pop 出来。]

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validateStackSequences(int[] pushed, int[] popped) {
        int N = pushed.length;
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
        
        int j = 0;
        for(int num: pushed) {
            stack.push(num);
            while(!stack.isEmpty() && j<N && stack.peek()==popped[j]) {
                stack.pop();
                j++;
            }
        }
        return j == N;
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis
1. Time Complexity: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of pushed and popped.
2. Space Complexity: `O(N)`. 


## Method 2. Do push & pop operations on Array.
Key Points:
1. Consider the `pushed` array as a stack.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validateStackSequences(int[] pushed, int[] popped) {
        int i = 0;      // index of pushed array
        int j = 0;      // index of popped array
        int idx = -1;   // index of stack array, we can regard pushed array as stack
                        // -1 means there is no element in the stack.
        
        int len = pushed.length;
        while(i < len) {
            pushed[++idx] = pushed[i];  // push operation
            // j<len: The popped array has not been finished yet.
            // idx>=0: There has element in the stack
            while(j<len && idx>=0 && pushed[idx]==popped[j]) {	// pop opertion
                j++;
                idx--;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return idx==-1 && j==len;
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis
1. Time Complexity: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of pushed and popped.
2. Space Complexity: `O(1)`.
