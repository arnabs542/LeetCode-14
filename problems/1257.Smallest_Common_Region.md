    * 235.Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
    * 236.Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
* Hints:
    * Try to model the problem as a graph problem
    * The given graph is a tree
    * The problem is reduced to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree 


## Method 1.
1. Build family tree from offsprings to their parents;
2. Use a HashSet to construct ancestry history of region1;
3. Retrieve ancestry of region2 by family tree till find the first common ancestry in ancestry history of region1.

```java
class Solution {
    public String findSmallestRegion(List<List<String>> regions, String region1, String region2) {
        Map<String, String> parents = new HashMap<>();
        Set<String> ancestryHistory = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Set the parent of each smaller region
        for(List<String> region: regions) {
            for(int i=1; i<region.size(); i++) {
                parents.put(region.get(i), region.get(0));
            }
        }
        
        while(region1 != null) {
            ancestryHistory.add(region1);
            region1 = parents.get(region1); // Find the parent of region1
        }   // After the while loop, region1 is the largest ancestor of region1
        
        while(!ancestryHistory.contains(region2)) {
            region2 = parents.get(region2);
        }
        return region2;
    }
}
```
Complexity:
    
    Time & space: O(n), where n is the the number of totoal regions.
