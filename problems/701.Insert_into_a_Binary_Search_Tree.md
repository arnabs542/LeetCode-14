One of the huge BST advantages is a **search** for *arbitrary* element in `O(log N)` time.
Here we'll see that the insert time is `O(log N)`, too, in the average case.

Analysis:
The problem solution is very simple - one could always insert a new node as a child of the leaf.
To define which leaf to use, one could follow the standard BST logic:
* If `val > node.val`, go to insert into the right subtree;
* If `val < node.val`, go to insert into the left subtree.

## Method 1. Recursion
The recursion implementation is very straightforward:
* If `root` is null, return `new TreeNode(val)`;
* If `val > root.val`, go to insert into the right subtree;
* If `val < root.val`, go to insert into the left subtree;
* Return `root`

```java 
class Solution {
    public TreeNode insertIntoBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        if(root == null) {
            return new TreeNode(val);
        }
        
        if(val > root.val) {    // Insert into the right subtree
            root.right = insertIntoBST(root.right, val);
        } else {                // Insert into the left subtree, because new value does not exist in the original BST
            root.left = insertIntoBST(root.left, val);
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
```  
Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity : O(H), where H is a tree height. That results in O(log N) in the average case, and O(N) in the worst case.
    Space complexity : O(H) to keep the recursion stack, i.e. O(log N) in the average case, and O(N) in the worst case.


## Method 2. Iteration
```java 
class Solution {
    public TreeNode insertIntoBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        TreeNode node = root;
        
        while(node != null) {
            if(val > node.val) {    // Insert into the right subtree
                if(node.right == null) {    // insert now
                    node.right = new TreeNode(val);
                    return root;
                } else {
                    node = node.right;
                }
            } else {                // Insert into the left subtree
                if(node.left == null) {     // insert now
                    node.left = new TreeNode(val);
                    return root;
                } else {
                    node = node.left;
                }
            }
        }
        return new TreeNode(val);
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity : O(H), where H is a tree height. That results in O(log‚Å°N) in the average case, and O(N) in the worst case.
    Space complexity : O(1) since it's a constant space solution.
