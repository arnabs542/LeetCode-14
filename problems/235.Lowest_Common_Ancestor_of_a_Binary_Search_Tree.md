LCA: The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).


Lets review properties of a BST:
1. Left subtree of a node N contains nodes whose values are lesser than or equal to node N's value.
2. Right subtree of a node N contains nodes whose values are greater than node N's value.
3. Both left and right subtrees are also BSTs.



## Method 1.
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root == null) {
            return root;
        }
        while(true) {
            if(p.val < root.val && q.val < root.val) {
                root = root.left;
            } else if(p.val > root.val && q.val > root.val) {
                root = root.right;
            } else {
                return root;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis
1. Time Complexity : O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the BST. In the worst case we might be visiting all the nodes of the BST.
2. Space Complexity : O(1)O(1)O(1).
