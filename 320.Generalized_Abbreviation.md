## Method 1. Backtracking
> How many abbreviations are there for a word of length n? The answer is 2^n because each character can be either be abbreviated or not, resulting in different in different abbreiviations.
>
> In this problem, the partial candidates are incomplete abbreviations that can be extended by one of the two choices:
> 1. Keep the next character;
> 2. Abbreviate the next character.

```java 
class Solution {
    public List<String> generateAbbreviations(String word) {
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<String>();
        backtrack(word, 0, 0, new StringBuilder(), res);
        return res;
    }
    
    // i is the current position
    // k is the count of consecutive abbreviated characters
    private void backtrack(String word, int i, int k, StringBuilder sb, List<String> res) {
        int len = sb.length();  // Keep the length of sb
        if(i == word.length()) {
            if(k != 0) {
                sb.append(k);
            }
            res.add(sb.toString());
        } else {
            // The branch that word.charAt(i) is abbreivated
            backtrack(word, i+1, k+1, sb, res);
            
            // The branch that word.charAt(i) is kept
            if(k != 0) {
                sb.append(k);
            }
            sb.append(word.charAt(i));
            backtrack(word, i+1, 0, sb, res);   // 
        }
        sb.setLength(len);  // 这种写法在开头记录 `sb` 的长度，在结束的时候 reset `sb` 的长度。所以在 #37 之后，不用再操作什么
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity : O(n 2^n). For each call to backtrack, it either returns without branching, or it branches into two recursive calls. All these recursive calls form a complete binary recursion tree with 2n2^n2n leaves and 2n−1 inner nodes. For each leaf node, it needs O(n) time for converting builder to String; for each internal node, it needs only constant time. Thus, the total time complexity is dominated by the leaves. In total that is O(n 2^n).
    Space complexity : O(n). If the return list doesn't count, we only need O(n)O(n)O(n) auxiliary space to store the characters in StringBuilder and the O(n)O(n)O(n) space used by system stack. In a recursive program, the space of system stack is linear to the maximum recursion depth which is nnn in our problem.
