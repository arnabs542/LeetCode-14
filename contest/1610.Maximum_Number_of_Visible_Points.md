[1610. Maximum Number of Visible Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-visible-points/)

* Nvidia
* Two Pointers, Geometry
* Hints:
    * Sort the points by polar angle with the original position. Now only a consecutive collection of points would be visible from any coordinate.
    * We can use two pointers to keep track of visible points for each start point.
    * For handling the cyclic condition, it'd be helpful to append the point list to itself after sorting.

```java
class Solution {
    public int visiblePoints(List<List<Integer>> points, int angle, List<Integer> location) {
        //strategy: find angle & prefix sum
        int locX = location.get(0);
        int locY = location.get(1);
        int onTop = 0;
        TreeMap<Double, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();
        //find all the angles between the different points and the location
        for (List<Integer> p : points) {
            //find how many points are on top of location
            //problem said we can see these points regardless of rotation
            if (p.get(0) == locX && p.get(1) == locY) {
                onTop++;
                continue;
            }
            //calculate our angle
            double a = (Math.atan2(p.get(1) - locY, p.get(0) - locX) * 180 / Math.PI + 360) % 360;  // [0, 360)
            map.put(a, map.getOrDefault(a, 0) + 1);
        } 
        //starting from 0 degrees on Cartesian plane & CCW
        //prefix sum: including means we include up to the angle & not including means we don't include up to the angle
        TreeMap<Double, Integer> including = new TreeMap<>();
        TreeMap<Double, Integer> notIncluding = new TreeMap<>();
        int count = 0;
        for (Double key : map.keySet()) {
            notIncluding.put(key, count);
            count += map.get(key);
            including.put(key, count);
        }
        //do it a second time so we can include angles greater than 360 in case our interval stretches past 360
        //example would be starting at 270 and the angle is 170
        for (Double key : map.keySet()) {
            notIncluding.put(key + 360.0, count);
            count += map.get(key);
            including.put(key + 360.0, count);
        }
        //prefix sum and find max interval
        int max = 0;
        for (List<Integer> p : points) {
            //find angle
            double a = (Math.atan2(p.get(1) - locY, p.get(0) - locX) * 180 / Math.PI + 360) % 360;
            //can only do floor because it can't go past the viewing angle
            Double endingAngle = including.floorKey(a + angle);
            if (endingAngle != null) {
                //find the largest interval from not including angle a to including ending angle
                max = Math.max(max, including.get(endingAngle) - notIncluding.get(a));
            }
        }
        //max interval + points on top of location
        return max + onTop;
    }
}
