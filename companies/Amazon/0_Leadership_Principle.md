Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."

Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 

Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.


客户痴迷

领导者从客户开始，然后倒退。他们努力工作以赢得并保持客户的信任。尽管领导者关注竞争者，但他们仍然痴迷于客户。

所有权
领导者是主人。他们认为是长期的，不会为短期结果牺牲长期价值。他们不仅代表自己的团队，还代表整个公司行事。他们从不说“那不是我的工作”。

发明和简化
领导者期望并要求其团队进行创新和发明，并始终寻求简化方法。他们具有外部意识，可以从任何地方寻求新的想法，并且不受“此处未发明”的限制。在我们做新事情时，我们接受我们可能会长期误解。

是的，很多
领导者很正确。他们有很强的判断力和良好的直觉。他们寻求不同的观点，并努力证明自己的信念。

学习和好奇
领导者永远都不会学习，总是寻求自我完善。他们对新的可能性感到好奇，并采取行动探索它们。

雇用和发展最好的
领导者每次聘用和晋升时都会提高绩效标准。他们认识到卓越的人才，并乐意将他们转移到整个组织中。领导者要培养领导者，并认真对待自己的教练角色。我们代表员工开展工作，发明诸如“职业选择”之类的发展机制。

坚持最高标准
领导者有着无情的高标准-许多人可能认为这些标准过高。领导者不断提高标准，推动他们的团队提供高质量的产品，服务和流程。领导者确保缺陷不会下传，并且问题已得到解决，因此问题得以解决。

想大
认为小是一种自我实现的预言。领导者创造并传达大胆的方向以激发成果。他们有不同的想法，四处寻找服务客户的方式。

行动偏见
速度至关重要。许多决定和行动是可逆的，不需要大量研究。我们重视计算的风险承担。

节俭
事半功倍。约束会滋生足智多谋，自给自足和发明创造。增加员工人数，预算规模或固定费用没有额外的要点。

获得信任
领导者专心聆听，坦率说话，并尊重他人。他们口头批评自己，即使这样做尴尬或尴尬。领导者不相信他们或他们的团队的体味有香水味。他们将自己和他们的团队与最佳水平进行比较。

深潜
领导者在各个层面上运作，与细节保持联系，经常审核，并且对度量和轶事有所不同持怀疑态度。他们下面没有任务。

有骨干；反对并承诺
当领导人不同意决策时，即使他们感到不舒服或筋疲力尽，他们也必须尊重他们的决策。领导者有信念并且坚韧。他们不会为了社会凝聚力而妥协。一旦决定，他们将全权负责。

交付结果
领导者专注于业务的关键投入，并以适当的质量和及时的方式交付给他们。尽管遭受了挫折，但他们还是挺身而出，从不解决。
